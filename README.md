# FPGA_Slot_Machine
A slot machine created in System Verilog. It was built, simulated, synthesized, and implemented in Vivado, on the Xilinx Basys 3 board.

This is my final project for my first Digital Design class as a freshman EE at Cal Poly.

I enjoyed the class a lot, and can picture myself doing more stuff like this for a career.
